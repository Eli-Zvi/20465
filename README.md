# **MMN14 - The Main Project - Assembly Compiler in C**

This project is an assembler written in C for a custom assembly language. It reads source files, processes assembly instructions, and outputs machine code. The assembler is designed with readability, modularity, and well-structured data handling.

## **Features**

- Parses a custom assembly language

- Validate syntax and operand types.

- Translate assembly instructions into binary machine code.

- Output the resulting machine code in a specified format.

## **How to Use**

- Write an assembly program using the defined syntax.
  
- Run the assembler to translate the code into machine code.
  
- Load the machine code into the imaginary CPU for execution.
