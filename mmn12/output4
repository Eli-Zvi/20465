Please type in the number of bytes you want to compare

Please type in the first index

Please type in the second index

Please type in a string

The number of bytes to be checked are:6
The first index is:3
The second index is:9
The string is:0aq terbt terbtasdqweqghfsasada

The bytes that will be compared are:
#1: terbt
#2: terbt

The bytes are equal
