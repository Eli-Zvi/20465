All integers should be between 0-511 otherwise the program will be terminated
if no integer is given the program will treat it as 0
if the sum of the length and one of the indexes is bigger than the length of the string the program will be terminated
String input should be 512 characters long at most, any characters after will be ignored

Please type in the number of bytes you want to compare

Please type in the first index

Please type in the second index

Please type in a string

The number of bytes to be checked are:15
The first index is:3
The second index is:9
The string is:              askdsmadklasmdklsamdskladsakldjsladjasdjksalkdksdljadklsjdlnsan

The bytes that will be compared are:
#1:           askd
#2:     askdsmadkl

The bytes are not equal
